# SOLID Design Principles

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that provide a foundation for writing software that is **loosely coupled, modular, maintainable, and easy to test.** While these principles are most commonly associated with object-oriented programming, they can also be applied at **different levels and stages of software design and development.** The SOLID principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob).

The five SOLID principles

- **S — Single Responsibility Principle**
- **O — Open-Closed Principle**
- **L — Liskov Substitution Principle**
- **I — Interface Segregation Principle**
- **D — Dependency Inversion Principle**

### Diagram Sample

[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html) plugin is the primary diagram renderer. Consider using the same, however image embedding is also allowed as well using `![Image](relative path to image)`
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

### Multi Language Code Sample

> Place the imports near the top of the file

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="id_hw_js" label="JS">
```js title="HelloCodeTitle.js"
function HelloCodeTitle(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="id_hw_cs" label="C#" default>
```csharp title="HelloCodeTitle.cs"
public void HelloCodeTitle(props) 
{
  return Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
