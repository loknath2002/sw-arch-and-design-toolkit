#  Anatomy of a design pattern

A design pattern provides a schema for **refining the sub-systems or components** of a software system or components of a software system or the relations between them. It describes a **commonly-recurring** structure of communicating components that **solves a general design problem** within a **particular context** <sup><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a></sup>

When boiled down to it's core a design pattern
- Provides a **reusable solution** to a **commonly occurring** software problem.
- Provides a **well known solution** for a **common** problem under certain **context**.
- Provides a **template** to solve a **well known problem** under **well known context**.


## Parts of a design pattern

Every design pattern has 4 parts associated to it 

### 1. Context

Design Situation which gives rise to the design problem. This allows to describe the problem in real world terms.

Consider the following case-study, `ClassA` and `Class` B would like to use awesome features from `ClassC`, however creation of ClassB requires one big complicated step. 

### 2. Problem

Set of problems which arise in the given context.

From the case-study, few obvious problems are

- ClassA and B will need to know more than required details of ClassC.
- ClassC's dependencies/imports/headers/usings are required to be inherited by Class A and B.
- Changes in creation steps of ClassC will break ClassA and ClassB.

### 3. Solution

Describes the elements that make up the design, including their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations. 

The solution for the case-study is to encapsulate the steps required to create `ClassC` into a single function/class, i.e `ClassC` object is created exposing the creation logic to `ClassA` and `ClassB`. This resembles [**Factory**](/docs/sw-design//desing-patterns/creational/factory-design-pattern.mdx) pattern, since factory hides the creation logic, dependencies and details of `ClassC`. 

### 4. Consequences

Each pattern will come with positive and negative consequences, it is important to understands these since it helps choosing a design pattern based on trade-offs, and impacts of applying the pattern on the software's quality. 

For the case-study, applying Factory pattern will have the following consequences
- ✅Ensures Loose coupling between classes, reduces dependencies while encouraging encapsulation.
- ✅Encourages Single responsibility principle, factory ensure the object creation logic is centralized.
- ✅Encourages testable interfaces.
- ❗Increase in overall complexity due to additional class.
- ❗Potential performance and memory overhead, (this for instance might be critical in Embedded Systems)

## Pattern Classification

There are various category of pattern some being simple and low level and some being high level and some in the middle, they are  *Idioms*, *Architectural patterns* and *Design Patterns* respectively.

The main focus of this page is design pattern and these are classified as follows
- **[Creational patterns](/docs/category/creational-patterns)** : Provides various ways to create objects.  
- **[Structural patterns](/docs/category/structural-patterns)** : Provides various arrangements of objects to compose a larger structure.
- **[Behavioral patterns](/docs/category/behavioral-patterns)** : Provides various ways to enable communication and control runtime behavior.
